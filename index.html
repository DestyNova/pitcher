  Games for training your absolute pitch skills. I'm not sure whether they really work yet.

  <ul>
    <li><a href="IncrementalPiano.html">Incremental piano</a> &mdash; locate a pitch on a piano keyboard with a gradually reducing margin of error. Helps to get a sense for what octave a note lies in.</li>
    <li><a href="QuickPitch.html">Quick pitch</a> &mdash; Quickly discriminate between random notes and a target note. The speed aspect helps to train your absolute pitch recognition for each note, rather than relying on relative pitch skills.</li>
  </ul>
