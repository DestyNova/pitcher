      <h3><a href="IncrementalPiano.html">Incremental piano</a></h3>
      <p>Locate a pitch on a piano keyboard with a gradually reducing margin of error. Helps to get a sense for what octave a note lies in.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-3">
      <h3><a href="QuickPitch.html">Quick pitch</a></h3>
      <p>Quickly discriminate between random notes and a target note. The speed aspect helps to train your absolute pitch recognition for each note, rather than relying on relative pitch skills. Try starting with a high probability of hearing the target note (e.g. 30%), then reduce it as you become accustomed to the task to increase the difficulty level.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-3">
      <h3><a href="PitchTest.html">Pitch test</a></h3>
      <p>A blind test of pitch identification ability. A series of random tones are presented and the user requested to identify each one within a short timeframe. No feedback is given until the end, where a score will be given, broken down by the individual scores for each pitch heard.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-sm-3">
      <h3><a href="Aleatoric.html">Aleatoric note generator</a></h3>
      <p>A random note generator that might help flush your short-term memory. Or interfere and make things worse?</p>
